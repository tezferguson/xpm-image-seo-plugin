= How much does it cost to use? =

The plugin uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, which is very cost-effective. Typical costs are around $0.001-0.003 per image, depending on image complexity. For example, processing 1000 images might cost $1-3 USD.

Absolutely! You can provide a custom prompt in the plugin settings to tailor the AI's output to your specific needs, brand voice, or industry requirements.
