== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an OpenAI API key? =

The OpenAI API key is only required for AI-powered alt text generation. The image optimization, lazy loading, and post duplication features work independently without an API key.

= How much does the OpenAI integration cost? =

The plugin uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model, which is very cost-effective. Typical costs are around $0.001-0.003 per image. For example, processing 1000 images might cost $1-3 USD.

= Does the post duplicator work with Elementor? =

Yes! The post duplicator has full Elementor support and will duplicate all page designs, widgets, settings, and custom CSS perfectly. It also supports other page builders like Beaver Builder, Divi, and Visual Composer.

= Can I duplicate WooCommerce products? =

Absolutely! The duplicator works with all post types including WooCommerce products, custom post types, and preserves all custom fields and metadata.

= Will duplication affect my SEO? =

All duplicated content is created as drafts by default, so it won't affect your SEO until you publish it. You can then edit the content to make it unique before publishing.

= Does it work with custom fields and ACF? =

Yes, the duplicator fully supports Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), Meta Box, Custom Fields Suite, and other custom field plugins. All field data is preserved during duplication.

= Can I customize how duplication works? =

Yes! You can configure the default status (draft/pending/private), author assignment, title suffix, and enable/disable the feature entirely in the settings.

= Will it slow down my website? =

No, all processing happens in the background with proper rate limiting. The lazy loading feature actually improves your site's performance by reducing initial page load times.

= What image formats are supported? =

The plugin works with all standard WordPress image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) for optimization and alt text generation.

= Can I review duplicated content before it goes live? =

Yes, all duplicated posts are created as drafts by default, giving you full control over when and if they're published.
